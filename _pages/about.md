I qualified as a teacher in 1988 and as a specialist in dyslexia in 2005. Over the years, I've taught in both state and independent schools and tutored over 100 pupils, from age 5 to adult ! 
I offer 1 to 1 tuition in all school subjects for children in KS1,2 and 3, and in English to adult, with my specialism being in the support of dyslexic learners.
